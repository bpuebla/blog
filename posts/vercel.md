i am only now using vercel and i really understand how cool it actually is.

i think it is probably the most complete web application deployment platform in the game right now.

- auto CI/CD : push and it's deployed as long as you follow their design patterns
- domains: buy or assign domains, automatic CNAME and A
- SSL cert: autogenerated with Let's Encrypt
- fast due to server side rendering
- other stuff i haven't even looked at (cdns, analytics)

I've always looked up to Guillermo Rauch but using his platform has made me have even more respect for him
